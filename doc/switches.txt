If ICI is invoked without switches, i.e., the first command line argument
does not start with a '-', then all the command line arguments are made
available to the user's program via an extern variable called argv, an
array of strings. The first element is the name of the ICI program with
subsequent elements being the arguments.

If ICI is invoked with switches, the first command line argument starts
with a '-', then the arguments are interpretered by the ICI interpreter.
The following switches are recognised,

--		End of switches, all remaining arguments are placed in
		the ICI program's argv array.

-v		Outputs a message to stderr describing the version
		of the ici interpreter and exits.

-m name		Use name as the name of the module being parsed. The
		ICI program's argv[0] is set to name. This is done prior
		to any files being parsed.

-f pathname	Parse the named file.

-l pathname	Parse the named library file. Library files are stored
		in a central directory, /usr/local/etc/ici by default and
		a '.ici' extension is automatically added to the name.

-e expression	Parse the expression. Multiple -e's may be given and
		may also be mixed with other switches.

-#		# is a decimal digit. Parse a module from a specific
		file descriptor.

-s		If ICI has been built with the startup file enabled
		(true on Unix using the default configurations) then
		this tells it not to load the startup file.

Any arguments not starting with a '-' are placed in the ICI programs argv
array. Such arguments DO NOT constitute the end of switch processing. The
'--' switch must be used if that behaviour is required.
