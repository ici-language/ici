<h2>
New ICI stuff, March 2002</h2>
Well, I had a week off to work on ICI. Here is a summary of the changes.
Unfortunately, at time of writting I still have some testing to do, and
there is some porting work to do, and I haven't checked it in. Checkin
will be fairly soon. Beware that the head of development will be unproven
for a while. Comments to <a href="mailto:ici@research.canon.com.au">the
ICI mail list</a> welcome of course.
<h3>
Highlights</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Multi-threading.</li>

<li>
Arrays double ended (i.e. queues as well as stacks).</li>

<li>
Major documentation upgrade.</li>

<li>
More than just structs can have supers.</li>

<li>
Object header reduced from 8 to 4 bytes.</li>

<li>
Dense allocation of small objects.</li>

<li>
Struct indexed by string lookaside mechanism improved.</li>

<li>
Faster and smaller (as a consequence of some of the above and other changes).</li>
</ul>
I have moved to major version number to 4, as external C interfaces will
(at least) require re-compilation. Possible some small changs as well.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Multi-threading</h3>
I've added native OS based multi-threading to ICI. This was tricky to add
without slowing things down, but I managed it. The model is very simple,
and treats all ICI data and objects as a single shared resource. So ICI-bound
programs will happily multi-thread, but not take advantage of multiple
processors. However, time spent in I/O or suitable heavy computing tasks
outside of ICI are truly independent. It has minimal impact on the C side
of things.
<p>The language suppport for this is:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exec = thread(callable, args...)</pre>
starts a new thread that calls <i>callable</i> (e.g. a function or method)
and passing
<i>args</i>. Returns an execution context. The thread runs
until <i>callable</i> returns.
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critsect <i>statement</i></pre>
executes <i>statement</i> indivisibly with respect to other threads. Eg:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critsect ++shared_counter;</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; critsect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; item = shared_list;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shared_list = item.next;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>
More importantly:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waitfor (<i>wait-condition</i>; <i>wait-object</i>) <i>statement</i></pre>
waits till <i>wait-condition</i> is true, sleeping until <i>wait-object</i>
is woken up before each re-test of the condition. Once <i>wait-condition</i>
is true, <i>statemet</i> is executed. All of this is done under a critical
section except for the actual sleep on the <i>wait-object</i>. For example,
suppose <i>jobs</i> is an array to which things to-do get added occasionally
in some other thread.
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waitfor (nels(jobs) > 0; jobs)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; job = rpop(jobs);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* rpop? see below. */</pre>
Some other thread might have code:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; push(jobs, job);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wakeup(jobs);</pre>
The <i>wakeup</i> function wakes up all threads waiting on the given object,
which makes them re-evaluate their wait condition. The object can be anything.
An integer, a string, an array (as in this example). For example, a wakeup
is done on the execution context object of a thread when it exits.
<p>It was tricky to add multiple execution contexts to the execution engine
without slowing things down. Adding a single indirection in the top-of-stack
references added 10..20% to the execution time of some programs. In the
end I devised a method that didn't involve any additional indirection.
I also reduced the use of macros in this area (which I think makes it clearer
and easier to debug).
<p>On the C side there is not much impact. Current C code should not notice
any difference - it will just run with the global mutex taken and be indivisible
with respect to other ICI threads. You can call <i>ici_leave()</i> to release
the mutex. It gives you a pointer that you pass to <i>ici_enter()</i> to
re-aquire the mutex. For example:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exec_t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *x;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = ici_leave();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...read file or something...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici_enter(x);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>

<h3>
Arrays are now queues, not just stacks</h3>
Arrays can now be efficiently pushed and poped at the front as well as
the end. The new functions <i>rpush()</i> and <i>rpop()</i> achieve this.
I've always felt the lack of a good list type, but after coding an "ordered
set", I realised that it would be much more efficient and probably even
more useful if arrays became gowable circular buffers, rather than just
growable stacks as they have been before now. But anyone who has looked
at the parser/compiler/execution engine will realise that arrays-as-stacks
are critical to performance, so I couldn't afford to introduce any overhead.
<p>To solve this, internally arrays conceptually have two forms: pure stacks,
and the general case of being a queue. As long as no <i>rpush</i> or <i>rpop</i>
operations have been done, they have the same internal operation they always
did. All the important stacks used internally have this property. Once
an <i>rpush</i> or <i>rpop</i> has been done an extra pointer introduced
into arrays might be different from the base -- it is now a circular buffer.
In the general case you have to use new rules for accessing the contents
of arrays from C. This was probably the hardest change to make. Arrays
are used everywhere.
<p><i>rpush()</i> and <i>rpop()</i> seem like a small additional feature.
But after using it just a few times I think it was worth it. Lots of things
become easier to do.
<h3>
Documentation upgrade</h3>
I have given the documentation a major upgrade. I'm a long way from finished,
but it's heaps better than it was. On the understanding that you realise
this is still work-in-progress, and various chapters just finish in the
middle, I've put a snap-shot at <a href="http://www.zeta.org.au/~timl/ici.pdf">http://www.zeta.org.au/~timl/ici.pdf</a>
.Chapter 3 - Language Reference and chapter 5 - Core language functions,
are almost finshed.
<h3>
Allowing more than just structs to have supers</h3>
This has no visible effect on the language. But it means that in C you
can make objects that have supers. This means you can make intrinsic OO
objects that you can subclass and everything in complete generality.
<h3>
Object header reduced from 8 bytes to 4</h3>
I have reduced the universal header on objects from 2 x 32bit words to
1 x 32 bit word. This sounds like a major change, but was actually was
not too bad. The net change on execution time is neutral or slightly improved.
Basically I eliminated the type pointer. To get the type pointer now, it
uses a small integer to index an array of pointers. The down-side is you
have to call a function to register a new type to get your small int (which
you place in the object header when you make a new object of that type).
This in itself is not a big percentage improvement on memory use, but when
combined with the next thing...
<h3>
Dense allocation of small objects</h3>
ICI has long maintained the principle that each object is independently
malloced from the underling system. But the overheads on this are, I decided,
unjustifiable on hosted environments. The new scheme allocates chunks (currently
1024bytes) which are dense arrays of small objects. There are no boundary
words. So ints now consume just 8 bytes of memory each (previously 24+
bytes in real terms). The technique for eliminating boundary words, and
keeping the fast free lists, is to have alloc/free routines where the caller
is required to tell the free how much memory it asked for on the alloc.
Thus we have:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = ici_talloc(<i>type</i>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici_tfree(x, <i>type</i>);</pre>
and
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = ici_nalloc(<i>size</i>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici_nfree(x, <i>size</i>);</pre>
98% of the time this is really easy because the place you free the data
knows exectly how big it is. For the occasions where this is not convenient,
you can use the completely malloc/free equivalent:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = ici_alloc(<i>size</i>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici_free(x);</pre>
Unfortunately, in making this change I have lost all that beautiful debug
support that was put into the old allocator. I might go back and try to
retro-fit it sometime.
<p>The net effect of this is an improvement in CPU time and memory usage.
The improved CPU time comes mostly (I think) from a large total memory
bandwidth reduction into the processor cache. Especially on garbage collection.
(Before objects were so big they would just about fill a whole cache line
by themselves. Now a whole bunch come in together.) A "small" object is
one less than or equal to 64 bytes. Things over 64 bytes go straight to
malloc without further memory overhead.
<p>The down-side of this change (and the reason I didn't do it years ago)
is that the dense allocation can't be freed until you shut the interpreter
down with <i>ici_uninit()</i>. But I figured that in most applications
you want ICI to go faster and have lower peak memory usage; more than have
it reduce malloc heap usage between tasks.
<h3>
Improving the coherence of the struct-lookup lookaside mechanism</h3>
The struct-lookup lookaside mechanism is the process whereby strings record
by-pass information to avoid actual searching of struct hash tables and
chasing up the super chain. There is a universal serial number that can
be incremented to invalidate all such by-pass records. It is now incremented
a lot less often, which means the lookaside works more often, which makes
things faster.
<h3>
Other speed-ups</h3>
There are a few other speed-ups that are a bit too technical to go into
here. Calls from C to ICI are faster.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Change log</h3>
Here is the change log so far...
<pre>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added an ici_pcre() function to avoid exposing internals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of PCRE in the ici.h include file.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the definition of the struct lookup look-aside cache
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stored in strings. It used to apply only to variables. But
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now it applies to all struct lookups. That meant it could be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cleaned up and the number of times it is invalidated (by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incrementing ici_vsver) greatly reduced. This makes a good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; improvement in execution speed.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generalised the super mechanism. Objects that want to support
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a super (still only structs in the core language) use the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new type objwsup_t (object-with-super) instead of object_t
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as their header. This includes the super poiner. They must
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then also set the O_SUPER flag in their header. They must also
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; support some extra fetch/assign functions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are quiet a few place where struct_t types became
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objwsup_t types as a consequence of this.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removed the version number from the naming of auto-loading
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICI modules (but not native code modules). Thus, for example,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the version 3 startup file was called:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici3core.ici
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but it will now be called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icicore.ici
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the ICI language (as opposed to its internal APIs)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is sufficiently stable that it is not really required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found it an unnecessary inconvenience.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed chkbuf() to ici_chkbuf().

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added a new basic type "handle". This not accessible from the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; core language, but C code can use it to return generic references
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to C data objects. It supports a super pointer, so C code
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can associate a class (i.e. a struct full of intrinsic methods)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with it to allow it to be used as an OO object (which can also
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identify it as an object of the expected type when passed back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from ICI code). It also allows a type name to be associated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the handle which will appear in diagnostics.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed 'error' to 'ici_error'.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed ici_evaluate() to use a catch object on its C stack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as its frame marker on its ICI execution stack. This avoids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an object allocation on each ici_evaluate call. The arguments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to ici_evaluate have changed slightly as a consequence.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removed syscall functions from the core. They will only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be accessible through the sys module in future.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the allocation routines to allocate small objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; densly (no boundary words) out of larger chunks. The
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technique for eliminating boundary words, and keeping the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast&nbsp; free lists, is to have alloc/free routines where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the caller is required to tell the free how much memory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it asked for on the&nbsp; alloc. Thus we have:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = ici_talloc(type);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici_tfree(x, type);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = ici_nalloc(size);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici_nfree(x, size);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 98% of the time this is really easy because the place you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free the data knows exectly how big it is. For the occasions&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where this is not convenient, you can use the completely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malloc/free equivalent:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = ici_alloc(size);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ici_free(x);

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added a small array (32) of pre-generated small ints to allow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a quick check and use of these very common numbers.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the internal ICI calling convention. The call operator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object used to store the number of actual parameters to a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; function. Now an seperate int is pushed onto the operand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stack. There is now just a single static call operator.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because ints are not heavily optimised, a call from C to ICI
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now, typically, does no allocation until its in the main
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; execution engine.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moved the lib curses based text window feature out of the core.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will put it in an extension module soon.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed new_array() to take an int argument being the initial
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number of slots for the array to have. The caller can assume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that that many items can be pushed on. Use 0 for the default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed arrays so that they can be efficiently push()ed and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pop()ed at *both* ends. Thus they can be used to form efficent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; queues. Although apparently a small feature, queues are something
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I've always felt were important and missing from ICI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However this was a *big* change (much harder than the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object header change). The parser and execution engine rely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavily on arrays for their efficiency. To prevent an impact
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on them we distinguish arrays that have neve been used as a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; queue (never had the new functions rpush() or rpop() done on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them) from the general case. Virgin arrays are refered to as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stacks and have all the old semantics. But in the general case
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrays are now growable circular buffers. Were you don't know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the origin or history of an array, you must assume the general
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case and use some new knowledge, functions and macros to access it

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removed the feature of binary &lt;&lt; that allowed "array &lt;&lt; int".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been flagged for removal in the documentation for a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long time, and became difficult to support.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the universal object header(!) From 2 x 32 bit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words to 1 x 32 bit word. Theoretically this is a huge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change, but it was actually pretty easy. It requires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recompilation of external modules, and some changes to their
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source. Basically the type is now completely indicated by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the small int o_tcode field of the header. To find a pointer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the type structure you must index an array of pointers to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them. Use ici_typeof(o) for this. Types must now register their
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type_t structure to obtain their small int type code, which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they should remember and use when making new objects. After this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change, the next release will move to version 4 to keep extension
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modules with the new smaller objects seperate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall effect on CPU time seems to be neutral or a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slight improvement.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added multi-threading. This is based on native machine threads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the whole mass of ICI objects and static data is gated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through a single mutex. So it works fine except threads competing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the ICI execution engine will not take advantage of multiple
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; processors (but they will if they spend their time in functions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that release the mutex while running).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a little difficult to achieve this without slowing things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down. Introducing a single extra indirection in top-of-stack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accesses (the obvious way) adds up to 20% to the execution time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of some programs. But I managed it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New language contructs "waitfor (expr; obj) stmt" and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "critsetc stmt" have been added. As well as the "wakeup(obj)"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and "sleep(num)" functions. All I/O routines in the core
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; release the mutex around the low level I/O - except the parser.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (See new documentation.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, o_top, x_top and v_top macros got removed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use ici_os.a_top instead.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ICI Technical Description has been updated to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FrameMaker 6 format and split into seperate chapters;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each in a seperate source file.

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removed the obsolete function ici_op_offsq() and operator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o_offsq from from array.c, ici.def, and fwd.h.
